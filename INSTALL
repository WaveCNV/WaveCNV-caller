2. Installing WaveCNV-caller

. In a terminal window, change to the .../WaveCNV/caller/src/ directory.

. Configure the installation by running 'perl Build.PL'  on the command line.

. Answer questions as to the location of Samtools, VCFTools, and Tabix. If you
  are missing any tools or modules, the installer will offer you a way to
  automatically setup missing prerequisites.

. Run './Build installdeps' to install any missing perl dependencies.

. Run './Build installexes' to install any missing external tools.

. Run './Build hg19' to download and install the human reference genome from
  UCSC. Will be in the .../WaveCNV/caller/data/ directory

. Run './Build install' to compile any needed code and install executables in
  the .../WaveCNV/caller/bin/ directory. It is recommnded that you add this
  directory to your PATH environmental variable.

. You will have to manually install anything the installer fails to install
  automatically.


3. To run WaveCNV-caller

. Run .../WaveCNV/caller/bin/caller.pl with a segments file (see WaveCNV-segmenter), a VCF file, and optionally a BAM file for the sample and associated matched control/refererence. It is important to always supply a matched reference.

  Example: .../WaveCNV/segmenter/bin/segmenter.pl trio1.pileup

. Example data is included in the .../WaveCNV/segmenter/example_data/ directory.
