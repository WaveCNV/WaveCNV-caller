	Perl 5.10.0+
  	BioPerl 1.6901 (exact version required)
	Perl::Unsafe::Signals
	Inline::C

	Tabix

NOTE: You may need administrator rights to install some modules and tools.
      Also make sure to add external tools to your PATH environmental variable.
      You may also have to rerun the 'perl Build.PL' step belowif any tools
      were missing during initial configuration.


2. Installing WaveCNV-caller

. In a terminal window, change to the .../WaveCNV/caller/src/ directory.

. Configure the installation by running 'perl Build.PL'  on the command line.

. Answer questions as to the location of Samtools, VCFTools, and Tabix. If you
  are missing any tools or modules, the installer will offer you a way to
  automatically setup missing prerequisites.

. Run './Build installdeps' to install any missing perl dependencies.

. Run './Build installexes' to install any missing external tools.

. Run './Build hg19' to download and install the human reference genome from
  UCSC. Will be in the .../WaveCNV/caller/data/ directory

. Run './Build install' to compile any needed code and install executables in
  the .../WaveCNV/caller/bin/ directory. It is recommnded that you add this
  directory to your PATH environmental variable.

. You will have to manually install anything the installer fails to install
  automatically.


3. To run WaveCNV-caller

. Run .../WaveCNV/caller/bin/caller.pl with a segments file (see WaveCNV-segmenter),
  a VCF file, and optionally a BAM file for the sample and associated matched
  control/refererence. It is important to always supply a matched reference.

  Example: .../WaveCNV/segmenter/bin/segmenter.pl trio1.pileup

. Example data is included in the .../WaveCNV/segmenter/example_data/ directory.


4. WaveCNV-caller output

. Results will be in GVF format
